Description: Package contains standard running functions (aka. windowed, rolling, cumulative) 
  with additional options. The most of the functions are already implemented in R 
  (eg. base::cumsum, RcppRoll::roll_sum, zoo::rollsum) and runner does not improve 
  base or RcppRoll performance. Instead of speed improvement, runner provides 
  extended functionality like handling missings and varying window size. Package 
  brings also rolling streak and rolling which, what extends beyond range of 
  functions already implemented in R packages.
